# Changelog

## [3.2.0] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- Guild-queue contract: open_guild now takes the text channel for the play-order message (calling it again with another channel moves it) and returns the uuid of a track the previous owner started and never finished, requeued; GuildQueueSnapshot and GuildQueueResponse carry text_channel_id. The guild-queue routes join routes/broker.py's ALL and HttpBrokerClient.ROUTES_CALLED, so the peer route check covers them (#1048).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- Add the guild-queue contract to the broker seam: 14 routes under /guilds/{guild_id}, their response models, the GuildQueueClient protocol (part of BrokerClient) and HttpGuildQueueMixin on HttpBrokerClient. No broker serves the routes yet; the broker pod and the pin bump follow (#1048).

## [3.0.5] - 2026-10-08

### Changed

- Remove the unused broker prefetch (POST /prefetch, prefetch on the broker engine and client); prefetch is done by the player (#1036).

## [3.0.4] - 2026-10-08

### Changed

- Finish the checkout cleanup: no guild_path on checkout, a miss answers {}, BrokerEntry drops guild_file_path, and InMemoryMediaSearchClient is now LocalMediaSearchClient (#1036).

## [3.0.3] - 2026-10-08

### Changed

- Drop the TYPE_CHECKING import guards: Bot-facing helpers move to the gateway/dispatcher-only modules, and shared code types its injected objects with Protocols (#1036).

## [3.0.2] - 2026-10-08

### Changed

- Drop the single-process leftovers from the broker seam: checkout always answers with an s3_key, and stale comments are cleaned up (#1036).
