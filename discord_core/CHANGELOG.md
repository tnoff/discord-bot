# Changelog

## [3.0.3] - 2026-10-08

### Changed

- Drop the TYPE_CHECKING import guards: Bot-facing helpers move to the gateway/dispatcher-only modules, and shared code types its injected objects with Protocols (#1036).

## [3.0.2] - 2026-10-08

### Changed

- Drop the single-process leftovers from the broker seam: checkout always answers with an s3_key, and stale comments are cleaned up (#1036).
